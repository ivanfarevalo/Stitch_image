Implement stitching algorithm

###Message to Grader:

``python3 -d yellowstone5``

Folder output_images in project

Dear Grader:
I put a looot of time into this project and focused too much time in 
getting RANSAC to be optimized and implementing my own warp algortihm. Sadly I focues too long
on the warop algorithm and was unable to finisn in time. For this reason I used warp function which if
I believe most people were using. I implemented a histogram correction function as well. My program works with some
sets of images but not all, for sure with yellowstone5, redrock, westcampus1, and GrandCanyon1 and 2...
If you look at my code you can see I put a lot of effort on my own warp algorithm but could not get to work.

####Program Requirements:
Stiich 5 sets of images
####How to Run:


``python3 -d yellowstone5``

This program accepts one argument: (directory). “directory”
is the data directory, 
#### Output:
Folder output_images in project
